# Rag-ChatBot
RAG Chatbot using Ollama  This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that uses Ollama with LLaMA 3.2 to answer user questions based on uploaded documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV, XLSX). It combines LangChain, FAISS, and Gradio to enable local, private document-based Q&amp;A with fallback handling for unrelated queries.
